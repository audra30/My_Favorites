    <h2>Making Art</h2>
    <p>
      Drawing and making art is one of my favorite hobbies. I personally enjoy
      making and expirementing with new mediums. I also enjoy the feeling of
      finally finishing a sketchbook and looking through all newly filled pages.
      Some of my favorite mediums are:
      <li>Graphie</li>
      <li>Water Colour</li>
      <li>Mixed Media</li>
      <li>Charcoal</li>
      <li>Coloured Pencils</li>
    </p>

    <h2>Stardew Valley</h2>
    <p>
      Stardew Valley is easily one of my favorite video games. Stardew Valley is
      a game about our character moving to their granmpa's old farm and fixing
      it up.A few aspects about this game I really enjoy are that it's not that
      difficult, this helps the game have a more cozy comforting feeling.

    <h2>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild(BOTW)</h2>
    <p>
      BOTW is probably my favorite video game i enjoy the balance of adventure,
      combat, story and of course exploring the open world game. BOTW is about
      saving the kingdom of hyrule after a demon named Ganon took over a
      hundread years ago. Along with saving the kingdom our character Link also
      has to learn about his forgotten past to help save the future of his
      kingdom.
